# gateway-demo

Demonstrates a project layout and the code required to run on the Cuprous Secured Edge Gateway running
Cuprux, our own build of Linux targetting edge-based applications with security in mind.

The project is split into a `backend` and `frontend`. The `backend` will serve the `frontend` project
as a web application. The `frontend` will then connect to the `backend` and receive events per the
gateway's tamper switch being opened/closed.

## Releasing for Linux armv7 (The Cuprous Secured Edge Gateway with Cuprux)

Install the toolchain (Linux):

```
apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-musleabihf
```

...or for macOS:

```
brew install arm-linux-gnueabihf-binutils 
```

...and then build:

> If not already done, install the Rust target: `rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`.

```
cargo build --bin gateway-demo --release --target=armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```

The next step is to build the frontend in release form:

> If not already done, following the instructions for WASM here: https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction

```
(cd frontend && trunk build --release)
```

With all binaries built, we can now package:

```
sudo ./package-build-artefacts-linux.sh
```

This package will be built as a tar.gz file and the script will output its location. The archive
can be copied on to a gateway, decompressed and then its `install` script run.
